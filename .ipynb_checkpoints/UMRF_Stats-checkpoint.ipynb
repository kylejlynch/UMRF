    "This notebook demonstrates a current project of mine that logs weekly data from UMRF Ventures and performs statistics.\n",
    "UMRF Ventures is a start-up that opened in August of 2017 and runs a Level 1 call center that troubleshoots IT issues for common services for FedEx employees worldwide.\n",
    "Weekly, we receive performance data on each of our agents (e.g. Talk time, percentage of issues resolved, survey scores, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first started this project, we had accumulated months of data located in different locations including eml files as well as email accounts. After creating a dedicated email address to receive new agent call data, I began writing several programs to obtain, clean, format, and store all the data into two seaparte databases (DB) based on the type of data (Daily and Weekly data). Once the DBs were initialized with several programs (labeled with blue arrows in the accompanying flow diagram below) and using the Daily DB to correct for some mistakes in the Weekly data that occurred on FedEx's end (indicated by the blue dashed arrow), I wrote programs the would update the daily and weekly DBs on a daily and weekly basis, respectively (indicated by yellow arrows below)."
